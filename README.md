<h1>New and improved Krokben portfolio website.</h1>
<p>This project is an over the top reimagining of my portfolio website. Strictly for the purpose of demonstrating all the some of the things I've learnt in 2017/2018.</p>
<p>This project is built in <em>React</em> and <em>Redux</em> and fetches content from <em>Contentful</em>. To learn Webpack 4, I made my own boilerplate with the <em>airbnb config</em> for <em>ESLint</em> and <em>mini-css-extract-plugin</em> to compile <em>scss</em> to css.</p>

<code>yarn install</code>
